This project is a renewal of the current Cham Wings Airlines website. It provides a flight booking service for travelers, with the option to select seats and view flight offers. It also includes profile and companion management interfaces. Travelers can pay using the Stripe service. If they wish to cancel a booking, they can do so through the bookings interface.

For employees, there are interfaces for managing bookings, airports, and aircraft, along with a voice search service. Lastly, the system administrator has an interface for managing employees and their permissions.

This system differs from the previous version by offering additional values such as personal accounts, trip suggestions for users, an automated responder, and statistics for employees.
